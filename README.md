# Sales Forecasting for Inventory Optimization

Developed a machine learning model to predict product sales and optimize inventory using the Kaggle Store Sales Dataset. Preprocessed data by cleaning, creating new features, and splitting into training/testing sets. Trained and evaluated models including ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM, achieving high performance with the LSTM model. Visualized results using Matplotlib and developed a Streamlit dashboard for recommendations.

## Features
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Model training with ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM
- Visualization of results
- Streamlit dashboard for recommendations
